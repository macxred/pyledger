"""PyLedger package

**pyledger** is a Python package designed to standardize interaction with
accounting systems and facilitate interoperability between different
accounting software. It provides an abstract interface for a double accounting
system with an account chart, foreign currencies, arbitrary assets and vat or
sales tax management.

The package includes a stand-alone implementation of the interface that is
storing data solely in text files and thereby lends itself to version tracking
with git or any other versioning system.

The abstract interface can be implemented to connect to any accounting software
via RESTful API or other interfaces, allowing for standardized access to such
software or data exchange between differing systems.

See README.md at https://github.com/macxred/pyledger for setup instructions.
